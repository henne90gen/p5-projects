These are all my projects with p5.js

To try one out, just clone the whole repository and then start the python server by typing:

```
python server.py <project-folder>
```

The project will be hosted at http://localhost:8080

You can also just open the index.html file in one of the projects with your favorite web browser.

The 'empty'-project is a dummy that you can copy, to create a new project.
